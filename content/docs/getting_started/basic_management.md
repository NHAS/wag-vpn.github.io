# Managing Wag

## Signing in to the Management console

Make sure that you have `ManagementUI.Enabled` set as `true`, then do the following from the console:

```
sudo ./wag webadmin -add -username <your_username> -password <your-password-here>
```
Then browse to your management listening address and enter your credentials.

The web interface itself cannot add administrative users.
